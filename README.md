# Flight Price Prediction

## Overview

Flight Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to help travelers make informed decisions when booking flights. This project utilizes historical flight data, machine learning algorithms, and predictive modeling to forecast the price of airline tickets. By providing users with accurate price predictions, we empower them to plan their trips more efficiently and save money on their airfare.

## Features

- **Price Prediction**: Our model analyzes various factors such as destination, departure date, airline, and time of booking to provide users with an estimated price for their desired flight.

- **Data Visualization**: We offer interactive data visualizations to help users explore trends in flight prices based on their specific criteria, making it easier to choose the most cost-effective options.

- **Historical Data**: Our system incorporates historical flight data to ensure that predictions are as accurate as possible, taking into account seasonal variations and past trends.

- **Real-time Updates**: Flight prices can fluctuate frequently. We provide real-time updates to keep users informed about any changes in ticket prices for their chosen itinerary.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The project features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to travelers of all levels of technical expertise.

## How to Use

1. **Input Details**: Users can input details such as departure and arrival locations, departure date, and airline preferences.

2. **Get Prediction**: Clicking the "Predict Price" button will trigger the model to generate an estimated price based on the input criteria.

3. **Explore Trends**: Users can explore historical price trends for their chosen route and departure date, helping them make informed decisions about when to book their flight.
